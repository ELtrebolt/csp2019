      <h2>In middle school I learned how to use Scratch and created a lottery game!</h2>
      <h4>I first created a sprite for each digit that would go into the 5-digit lottery number. Then I created a variable that matched each digit sprite and would switch based on a random counter. 
          Lastly, I added a variable for the amount of money gained should the randomized lottery digit match an inputed (or another randomized) number.
          The result was an interesting take on a randomized lottery!

      <h2>Here my partner and I made an Arcade simulator that comes with different mini games!</h2>
      <h4>After brainstorming different ideas for our Arcade game, my partner and I decided we wanted a Whack a Mole Game and a Wheel Reaction Game.
          For the Whack a Mole, we decided that we should randomize the changing of a costume of a sprite to simulate the mole "popping" up. To "hammer" it, the user had to click on the changed costume before it "disappeared" and switched back.
          For the Wheel Reaction, it took a while to figure out how to make it at first. In the beginning we thought about changing costumes to simulate a ball moving, like with the Whack a Mole.
          In the end, we figured out that we could use colors to sense when the ball landed on the right spot. We made a sprite for the wheel and had it sense the different colors to land on the different spots as the ball moved around.

      <h2>Using MIT App Inventor, my partner and I created a Tic Tac Toe Game using basic touch-press mechanics!</h2>
      <h4>To start out, my partner and I made a basic 3 by 3 Tic Tac Toe game by changing the text in each box to X first, and O next if they pressed it again. We did it this way because it seemed like the easiest way to differentiate between Xs and Os.
          After creating the first 9 buttons and testing that our game worked, we decided to go a little beyond the normal Tic Tac Toe by creating even more buttons and expanding it to a 6 by 6 game.
          After copying and pasting all of the codes from the other buttons (with variables that sensed whether or not to print an X or O based on touch1/touch2), our game was complete!

      <h2>By coding with Python on repl.it, my partner and I used functions to create an interactive fiction game about a zombie apocalypse!</h2>
      <h4>Although in the beginning my team and I used a bunch of if-else statements to code the game, we ended up figuring out how to use functions to make the code smaller and easier to follow.
          Since we had already previously made a flow chart that depicted the story of our game, we were able to make a function for each decision that had to be made.
          In our game, you can become a zombie, befriend one, or save the world with your bravery!

      <h2>By coding with Python on the Canopy application, we were able to create a few different functions to generate both random and custom passwords!</h2>
      <h4>After learning how to use the basic Python functions including importing, randomizing, and creating variables, our group was first able to write the code for a randomized password with an inputed password length.
          Our next function was able to take any given input and stick it in the middle of randomized characters as a part of the finalized string.
          Then we decided to completely randomize the password by making a function that randomly generates the password length.
          Lastly, we wanted to make an almost completely customized password generator, by asking the user if they wanted to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, or symbols. After that, they could put in any other phrase they wanted and that would go into the final product.

      <h2>For my Create Project, I decided to use Python to code a program that calculates the Pythagorean Theorem and Trigonometric Equations on right triangles!</h2>
      <h4>With all of the previous knowledge in coding the past projects, I was able to print questions asking whether or not the user wanted to calculate the Pythagorean Theorem or Trigonometric Equations.
          Then I printed a right triangle and asked the user to input the values of side lengths A and B.
          The program would then calculate the hypotenuse by using the Pythagorean Theorem, and would print all of its work to show how it came to an answer.
          The Trigonometric Equations function would produce the correct ratios as decimal, simplified to 3 decimal places so that the code didn't have to show 10+ decimal places.

      <h2>In section 1.4, we learned how to manipulate images using Canopy!</h2>
      <h4>For my project I decided to manipulate the image of a pineapple by adding a colored border to it.
          I like to think of it as the "Flag of the Pineapple People."

      <h2>In Section 1.5 of the PLTW Course, we created a Graphic User Interface (GUI) using the Tkinter Canvas on Canopy!</h2>
      <h4>In the section, we learned how to make a canvas and add shapes to it. 
          We also learned how to animate using an animation functions, proper coordinates, and a speed variable!
          Our GUI is that of a green square that utilizes a direction variable to change the direction of the square. 
          Try to see how long you can keep the green square on the screen, and at the highest speed!

      <h2>In Section 3.1 of the PLTW Course, we learned about Big Data and asked "What is the median match time for challenger matches in 2018"</h2>
      <h4>In the section, we learned how companies collect tons of data about their consumers. 
          Whether it's social media accounts or even just your email, advertising is everywhere.
          Since my partner and I were both interested in tennis, we found lots of data from last year's Challenger matches.
          We were able to code the graphing on Canopy using Python by first opening the file, and then using a for loop to look for the right data.

      <h2>In Section 4.1.3 of the PLTW Course, we learned about Simulations on Net Logo Online"</h2>
      <h4>We started by playing around with the different simulations, initially starting with the wolf-sheep-grass one that depicted the populations changing over time. 
          We made our way through several simulations, noting how changing the factors affected the simulation's results. 
          After working with multiple simulations, we decided to try and change the bounce example one.
          We were able to change the color of the background, the shape of the balls (they are now "pyramids") and the angle at which they bounce.
