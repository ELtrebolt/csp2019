      <h2>In middle school I learned how to use Scratch and created a lottery game!</h2>
      <h4>I first created a sprite for each digit that would go into the 5-digit lottery number. Then I created a variable that matched each digit sprite and would switch based on a random counter. 
          Lastly, I added a variable for the amount of money gained should the randomized lottery digit match an inputed (or another randomized) number.
          The result was an interesting take on a randomized lottery!

      <h2>Here my partner and I made an Arcade simulator that comes with different mini games!</h2>
      <h4>After brainstorming different ideas for our Arcade game, my partner and I decided we wanted a Whack a Mole Game and a Wheel Reaction Game.
          For the Whack a Mole, we decided that we should randomize the changing of a costume of a sprite to simulate the mole "popping" up. To "hammer" it, the user had to click on the changed costume before it "disappeared" and switched back.
          For the Wheel Reaction, it took a while to figure out how to make it at first. In the beginning we thought about changing costumes to simulate a ball moving, like with the Whack a Mole.
          In the end, we figured out that we could use colors to sense when the ball landed on the right spot. We made a sprite for the wheel and had it sense the different colors to land on the different spots as the ball moved around.

      <h2>Using MIT App Inventor, my partner and I created a Tic Tac Toe Game using basic touch-press mechanics!</h2>
      <h4>To start out, my partner and I made a basic 3 by 3 Tic Tac Toe game by changing the text in each box to X first, and O next if they pressed it again. We did it this way because it seemed like the easiest way to differentiate between Xs and Os.
          After creating the first 9 buttons and testing that our game worked, we decided to go a little beyond the normal Tic Tac Toe by creating even more buttons and expanding it to a 6 by 6 game.
          After copying and pasting all of the codes from the other buttons (with variables that sensed whether or not to print an X or O based on touch1/touch2), our game was complete!

      <h2>By coding with Python on repl.it, my partner and I used functions to create an interactive fiction game about a zombie apocalypse!</h2>
      <h4>Although in the beginning my team and I used a bunch of if-else statements to code the game, we ended up figuring out how to use functions to make the code smaller and easier to follow.
          Since we had already previously made a flow chart that depicted the story of our game, we were able to make a function for each decision that had to be made.
          In our game, you can become a zombie, befriend one, or save the world with your bravery!
